World of Warcraft and the online black market.

<body>



<p>A question I had after learning about the impact of Venezuelan gold farmers on the Runescape economy with the natural experiment of a power outage in Venezuela. How are gold sellers influenced in other online game markets? For this first installment, of hopefully a few interesting projects, I am going to look at how the implementation of the wow token impacted wow gold sellers. (When I say wow, I mean World of Warcraft) The first thing we will do is set-up a few packages(forecast and prophet wont be used in this episode) and read in the data:</p>


<!--begin.rcode message=FALSE
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(zoo)
library(readstata13)
library(haven)
library(forecast)
library(prophet)
wowgold <-read.dta13("wowgold.dta", convert.dates = TRUE)
end.rcode-->

<p>So, I had the data in a stata file which the readstata13 package conveniently allows me to read it in as:</p>

<!--begin.rcode fig.width=7, fig.height=6
summary(wowgold)
end.rcode-->

<p>The date variable isn't in R format so we have to change it</p>
<!--begin.rcode
wowgold$time<- as.POSIXct(wowgold$date/1000, origin = "1960-01-10")
wowgold$rtime <- as.Date(wowgold$time)
end.rcode-->


<p>Looking at the summary you can see a large spread of the gold per dollar</p>
<!--begin.rcode
wowgold$gtousd <-log10(wowgold$usdtog)

end.rcode-->

<p>Knowing how important expansions are to wow, I added the release dates for each one in the data and also the wowtoken release date which we will cover later.</p>
<!--begin.rcode
wowgold$releasedatecata <- as.Date("2010-12-10 12:00:00")
wowgold$releasedatemop <- as.Date( "2012-09-25 12:00:00")
wowgold$releasedatedra <- as.Date( "2014-11-13 12:00:00")
wowgold$releasedatelegi <- as.Date( "2016-08-30 12:00:00")
wowgold$releasedatebfa <- as.Date( "2018-08-13 12:00:00")
wowgold$releasedategold <- as.Date("2015-04-07 12:00:00")
end.rcode-->


<p>Finally, we plot just how odd this data looks and how influential the expansions actually are:</p>
<!--begin.rcode html-wowgold-line, fig.width=15, fig.height=6
xpacs <- ggplot(wowgold, aes(x=rtime, y=gtousd)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group=region, color = region),  linetype=1)+
  scale_x_date(breaks = date_breaks("3 months"), labels = date_format("%Y-%m"))+
  theme( axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size =5))+
  labs(x = "Date", y="Gold to USD in Log", title="Gold to USD in World of Warcraft" ) +
  geom_vline(data = wowgold, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(releasedatecata)))+
  geom_vline(data = wowgold, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(releasedatemop)))+
  geom_vline(data = wowgold, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(releasedatedra)))+
  geom_vline(data = wowgold, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(releasedatelegi)))+
  geom_vline(data = wowgold, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(releasedatebfa)))+
  geom_vline(data = wowgold, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(releasedategold)))+
  geom_text(aes(x = releasedatecata, y = 3.5, label = "Cata"))+
  geom_text(aes(x = releasedatemop, y = 3.7, label = "Mop"))+
  geom_text(aes(x = releasedatedra, y = 3.6, label = "Draenor"))+
  geom_text(aes(x = releasedatelegi, y = 2.7, label = "Legion"))+
  geom_text(aes(x = releasedatebfa, y = 3.5, label = "BFA"))+
  geom_text(aes(x = releasedategold, y = 4.3, label = "Token"))

end.rcode-->



<p>Let's hone in on that portion where the tokens come into play and see what it looks like by patch now. If you didn't know, in each expansion they are comprised of content patches which will pace the game. They usually have around 3, but it varies with each expansion as expansions are more heterogeneous then homogeneous.</p>

end.rcode-->

<p>Looking at the plot you can see the sharp increase in gold prices, remember this is gold to usd, right after each expansion which shouldn't be surprising as people are spending their gold to buy game time. An oddity that will have to be investigated at another time is the Korean market dropping after 7.3.2 with an almost mirrored action in china with the opposite impact. North American and European prices do not fluctuate as much as the other regions. Some interesting questions come about with this plot that will be looked at in the next phase of this investigation.    </p>

<p>
Note: Data sources for black market gold prices came from a single server Aegywn-US as before token prices, each server's economy was generally self-contained and regulated itself based on population. Transfers from another server had a stipulation of only being able to bring 10k worth of gold over. This is circumvented by people due to items that may have significant value can be bought and sold on the new server, and therefore effectively removing the limit.
